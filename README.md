# Readme
I wanted to code something in a few hours, since I had sudden downtime and hadn't coded in about a decade, and this game (imaginatively titled "Squares") was the result. My goal was to make something from start to finish. Short of a main menu, including the ability to restart the game, I succeeded. I hope it's fun.

Just run the main file.

# Music

The music was taken from [Royalty Free Music Clips](https://www.royaltyfreemusicclips.com/pir/free_music_loops.shtml) and is ostensibly royalty-free.

# Heads-Up: Text file will be saved on your device
The game will create a text file when it runs to store a high score. Obviously, bit of a make-do solution, and I need to read-up on how to properly do that. But, yeah, if you want to restart the high score (or change it completely to impress anyone that you've scored a million or something), it's a .txt file.

# Probably embarrasing things
- Naming conventions are slapdash; there's a mixture of camel case and underscores. It'd be embarrassing, but I was typing furiously and testing, only refactoring code once or twice throughout to make fixes easier.
- Attempting to move the main loop into a different file added a two-second delay to starting the game. Not sure if there's a fix for that or if that slowness comes with Python.
